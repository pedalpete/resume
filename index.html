      <h2>An Innovator and Engineer with a dash of Artist, able to envision the future and use technology to make that future a reality. </h2>
      
      <hr>
     
      <p>
	  With a diverse background in everything from Marketing to Engineering, including founding two companies and developing industry leading technologies,I’ve got the diversity and passion to take on interesting projects and be an engaged member of a team. 
An appreciation of great UX/UI coupled with a Data Geek soul, I’ve worked with both front-end and back-end systems to make data interactive and create value through data-management usability.
	  </p> 
    <h3>Industry Leading Technology</h3>
      <p>
	 After recognizing a market opportunity, teaching myself to program and launching my first company (a Pandora like customised radio service), I built the world’s largest concert database, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/hearwhere" target="new">HearWhere</a>. Quickly recognized by the media as a unique and inventive service, the first concert listing site which let visitors sample artists music, as well as having an advanced artist popularity algorithm. I built an API around the data base and provided concert listings to Maxim Magazines music arm Blender.com among others. 
      </p> 
    <h3>Creating Modern Interfaces Since Forever</h3>
      <p>
	Not long ago, I realized that I have never built a conventional website. I’ve always developed back-end APIs to serve javascript heavy front-end single page sites. Originally working with plain-old Javascript and then moving to jQuery, and in the past few years, managing front-end work with a selection of modern frameworks including Backbone, Knockout, JQUI/Intel App Framework and Angular.js. I’ve worked on mobile HTML5 Applications wrapped in PhoneGap/Cordova which are in both the Google Play and Apple app stores. 
	  </p> 
    <h3>Data & Design</h3>
      <p>
	  In my previous experience, I’ve worked with large datasets and understand the importance of design both from a UI/UX perspective as well as data/information design. In developing a data-management system for Bravo Media, the task was to take a horrendously painful data-entry task and make it simple. With HearWhere, the data-design task was in the presentation of thousands of concerts to music fans in a way that helped them discover the artists they should go see or want to see.  
	  </p> 
      
    <h3>Innovator</h3>
    <p>I’ve worked with start-up companies in the past, as well as managing start-up projects within larger companies and building my own projects and businesses.  As my letters of reference will attest, finding creative solutions and understanding both business and user implications are where I really sink my teeth into a project.

            <p>Several years ago an unsolicited proposal arrived at the office of the CIO for Intrawest Corporation. The proposal described an opportunity to improve the company’s already best-of-breed customer service in its resort operations business by making information assets already in existence accessible to employees.  I recall being struck in particular by two things.  One was the maturity of architectural vision in the proposal; the writer recognized that the product information in point-of-sale systems embodied critical definitions about the resort business at any point of time, and consequently that this information could and should provide a coherent basis for service information. The second thing was the approach: the writer, an employee at Copper Mountain resort in Colorado, had the vision to outline a problem and a solution that would benefit the company broadly.</p><p>As a result of that, Pete Field was brought to Intrawest’s corporate headquarter and asked to spearhead an enterprise knowledge platform project.  The purpose of this letter is to provide my positive perspective on Pete’s abilities and accomplishments on that project, and to offer to provide further reference for him should it prove helpful to him.</p><p>Pete took charge of the ‘IWeb’ project, as it was called, and in the nearly two years he managed the project, combined the vision that his proposal had promised with attention to detail, persistence, and an outstanding work ethic to produce an innovative solution to the company’s needs.  In the course of the project, he also encountered most of the pitfalls that can make enterprise solution development so frustrating. He’s to be especially complimented for grinding through all those frustrations unflappably. As CIO, I was more closely involved with the iWeb project than most projects, but never doubted that Pete was the right person to head it up.</p><p>I would characterize Pete’s thinking on the iWeb project as being commercial software caliber work.  He spent considerable time on the difficult early work of analyzing the real challenges of knowledge and information management in the unique environment of that company and business, and envisioned an elegant, usable solution to those challenges. He evaluated commercial technologies and identified an appropriate, cost-effective solution, negotiating an extremely favorable price for Intrawest in the process. And he project-managed the undertaking through a very long gestation to a successful internal launch.</p><p>As a result, he’s got a skillset that I’ve only seen in Microsoft program managers; able to see the business, user, and technical sides of a solution simultaneously, and doggedly pursue it to completion.</p><p>Pete has vision and, probably more vitally, the grit to pursue it.  I’m sure he would say he learned a host of lessons on the iWeb project that would make him even more effective today.  I think Pete has the makings of a successful entrepreneur, especially in the areas of innovation which interest him so keenly.  He also has an unusual degree of patience and a perspective on his own work that is refreshing.  He expects himself to do big things. So do I.</p><p>If I can provide any further perspective on Pete, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p><p>Matthew Dunn<br/><br/>President, Socratech, Inc.  (Former CIO, Intrawest Corporation)</p>

            <p> I have known and worked with Pete Field on various projects since 1999.  These projects have been diverse, from developing an outdoor attraction at a summer resort to the most recent, developing an online data normalization tool.  The reason for this ongoing business relationship is due singularly to Pete’s broad skill set and how he applies it to the project at hand, ingeniously employing creative thinking with intelligent perspective.  Simply put, Pete does not think like most people.</p><p> My current business, MyLightingShowroom.com, provides turnkey website technology for brick and mortar distributors in the US and Canada.  The platform includes a database of 200 plus Lighting Manufacturer’s products.  Normalizing and ingesting these product files is a labour intensive task due to a lack of common structures and formats.  I wanted an web based tool that would greatly improve the efficiency of the normalization process and to produce a consistent output file that matched our database structure.  This type of tool does not currently exist in our industry and after some preliminary conversations with Pete he explained the process was programmatically possible and he was eager to take on the challenge.<p></p> When first hearing of Pete’s plan for building such a system, our Director of Development, Don Ferruggia, said “This is a very interesting idea.  In concept, it allows you to load data files directly from manufacturers without prior reformatting.  Subsequent files, after the first use for any particular manufacturer, will process much quicker.”  Since this is a never ending process, Pete identified an opportunity I and my Development Team had not even considered, and developed a “smart” tool that greatly improves our business processes.</p><p>In conclusion, I would highly recommend Pete Field for Start Up Chile – he demonstrates the qualities any incubator would want: intelligence, creativity, non-conformity, boot strap experience, and an unflagging entrepreneurial spirit.</p>Sincerely,</p><p>Greg Whelan</br/>General Manager, MyLightingShowroom.com</p>
